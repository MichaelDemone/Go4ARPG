  DisplayName: Blocking
  Description: Blocking allows you to lessen the amount of damage done to you but
    prevents you from attacking. When you do a long swipe to the right of your screen
    while in combat, a shield will appear over your character and you will be blocking.
    You cannot attack while blocking, but if the monster attacks it will do less damage
    based on your armor's stats. If you do a block while you see an enemy winding
    up for an attack it will be a 'perfect block' and will block more of the damage.
    Blocking does not affect elemental damage.
