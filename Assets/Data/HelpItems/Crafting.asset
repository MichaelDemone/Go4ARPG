  Description: Crafting allows you to make items from materials. Crafting is done
    in the crafting menu which is accessed by tapping the anvil on the top right of
    the screen. In the menu there is a drop down menu with "Craftable" and "Some Materials."
    "Craftable" allows you to see all the items you can currently make and "Some Materials"

    before it will be a question mark until you craft it.
