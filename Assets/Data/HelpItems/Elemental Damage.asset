  Description: Elemental damage is additional damage done by enchanted weapons to
    enemies or done by enemies to your player. This damage may be fire, electric,
    ice, poison, or dark. Elemental damage cannot be blocked. Some armors have elemental
    weaknesses and some enemies have elemental weaknesses. Try different weapons and
    armor against certain monsters to see what works the best.
