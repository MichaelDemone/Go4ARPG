  Description: Enchanting allows you to do elemental damage with your weapons. Enchanting
    is done through the enchanting menu which is accessed through the anvil in the
    top right. You simply supply a weapon to enchant and a gem (gotten from looting)
    and click the enchant button and you will enchant your weapon. This is a PERMANENT
    augmentation of your weapon so be sure you have a strong gem when you do it! The
    higher level weapon, the higher enchanting damage you should expect.
