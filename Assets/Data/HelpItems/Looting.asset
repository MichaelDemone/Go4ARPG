  Description: When you defeat an enemy they may drop some loot. Some may be materials
    that can be used for crafting or enchanting whereas others may be weapons, armor,
    or headgear that you can equip. When picking up weapons, armor, or headgear you
    will be prompted to trash or equip the item, trashing makes it so you don't see
    the item in your inventory but you can still sell it to shopkeepers, and equipping
    it makes it get equipped to your character.
