  DisplayName: Parrying
  Description: Parrying allows you to stun enemies and cancel their attacks. When
    you do a long swipe to the left of your screen while in combat you will attempt
    a parry. If the enemy was in the middle of an attack then the parry will be successful,
    a pair of swords will appear in between you and the enemy, and the enemy will
    be stunned allowing you to do more damage. If the parry was not timed properly,
    then an x will appear between you two and you will be stunned for a short time,
    allowing the enemy to do more damage to you.
