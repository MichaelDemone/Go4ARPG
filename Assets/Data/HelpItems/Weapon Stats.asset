  Description: 'A weapon has 3 main stats: level, mastery, and damage. Level is the
    level of the monster that dropped it and it cannot be changed. The mastery is
    your ability to use that type of weapon, so every ''Goblin Sword'' has the same
    mastery. Your mastery increases as you use the weapon type (so going from a level
    5 normal goblin sword to a level 10 normal goblin sword will only benefit you
    because the mastery is the same). Finally, damage is the damage the weapon does
    to the enemy if the enemy has no armor and includes bonuses from mastery. There
    is an additional damage on enchanted weapons which is elemental damage.'
