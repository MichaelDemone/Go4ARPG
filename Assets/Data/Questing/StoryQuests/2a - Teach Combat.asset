    Text: "Now that you've gotten the hang of tapping you're probably wondering \"How
      can I protect myself from damage?\" Well have I got the solution for you! \n\nIn
      combat you can can <b>swipe away from the enemy to block</b> their attacks and
      take less damage. Alternatively, you can <b>swipe towards the enemy to parry</b>
      to take no damage and stun the enemy, but mis-timing a parry can leave you vulnerable!\n\nYou
      have a short window while the enemy is winding up to block and an even shorter
      window while the enemy is mid-attack to parry. This chicken will glow blue when
      it is blockable and red when he is parryable."

    Text: "Good job! The enemies will continue to glow blue or red for the next few
      quests to allow you to practice, but after that you'll be on your own. \n\nRemember
      to click the question mark in the bottom right if you need help."
