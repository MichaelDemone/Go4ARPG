    Text: Nice new sword! You know what would go great with that sword? A new hat!
      You can craft a new feathered hat with a gnome hat and a feather by <b>tapping
      on the anvil in the top right</b> and then clicking on the crafting recipe that
      requires 1 feather and 1 gnome hat! If you can't make one yet, you <b>may not
      have enough materials</b>, so you'll have to <b>defeat a few chickens and gnomes</b>
      to get the material.

    Text: "Good job! You can equip that hat through the journal (top right book),
      going to the equip tab, and clicking the headgear box. The question mark in
      the bottom right can help you out if you get lost.\n\nIt won't actually help
      you in any way but you're gonna look so good. \n"
